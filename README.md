# Data-Structures-Algorithms-Course
Activities from a FreeCodeCamp Data Structure and Algorithms Activities

In this repocitory you will find my code learning Data Structure & Algorithms,
also I will add some extra problems that I'm going to solve to practice and master Data Structure & Algorithms,
It is divided by topics if you want to learn or give me any tips to improve it would be very nice, thanks and
I hope this repocitory helps anyone that is lost in the topic.

I'm using this video to learn Data Structure & Algorithms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA&t=675s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
The video uses an online page called Jovian (has guide about Data Structure & Algorithms): https://jovian.com/
